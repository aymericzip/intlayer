# Intlayer: Next-Level Content Management in JavaScript

**Intlayer** is an innovative Content Management System (CMS) designed specifically for JavaScript developers. It enables seamless transpilation of JavaScript content into structured dictionaries, making integration into your codebase straightforward and efficient.

## Why Choose Intlayer?

- **JavaScript-Powered Content Management**: Harness the flexibility of JavaScript to define and manage your content efficiently.
- **Type-Safe Environment**: Leverage TypeScript to ensure all your content definitions are precise and error-free.
- **Integrated Content Files**: Keep your translations close to their respective components, enhancing maintainability and clarity.
- **Simplified Setup**: Get up and running quickly with minimal configuration, especially optimized for Next.js projects.
- **Server Component Support**: Perfectly suited for Next.js server components, ensuring smooth server-side rendering.
- **Enhanced Routing**: Full support for Next.js app routing, adapting seamlessly to complex application structures.

## Getting Started with Intlayer

Setting up Intlayer in a Next.js application is straightforward:

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

Install the necessary packages using npm:

```bash
npm install intlayer next-intlayer intlayer-cli
```

```bash
yarn install intlayer next-intlayer intlayer-cli
```

```bash
pnpm install intlayer next-intlayer intlayer-cli
```

### Step 2: Update Package Scripts

Modify your `package.json` to include scripts for building and watching your dictionaries:

```json
"scripts": {
  "build": "next build",
  "dev": "next dev",
  "start": "next start",
  "transpile": "npx intlayer transpile",
  "transpile:watch": "npx intlayer watch"
}
```

### Step 3: Integrate Intlayer in Your Next.js Configuration

Configure your Next.js setup to use Intlayer:

```javascript
// next.config.mjs
import { withIntlayer } from "next-intlayer/server";

const nextConfig = {};

export default withIntlayer(nextConfig);
```

### Step 4: Configure Middleware for Locale Detection

Set up middleware to detect the user's preferred locale:

```javascript
// src/middleware.ts
export { intlayerMiddleware as middleware } from 'next-intlayer/middleware';

export const config = {
  matcher: '/((?!api|static|._\\.._|\_next).*),
};
```

### Step 5: Define Dynamic Locale Routes

Implement dynamic routing for localized content:

```typescript
// Change `src/app/page.ts` to `src/app/[locale]/page.ts`
```

### Step 6: Manage Your Content

Create and manage your content dictionaries:

```typescript
// src/app/[locale]/page.content.ts
import { t, type ContentModule } from "intlayer";

const pageContent: ContentModule = {
  id: "page",
  getStarted: {
    main: t({
      en: "Get started by editing",
      fr: "Commencez par Ã©diter",
      es: "Comience por editar",
    }),
    pageLink: "src/app/page.tsx",
  },
};

export default pageContent;
```

### Step 7: Utilize Content in Your Code

Access your content dictionaries throughout your application:

```typescript
// src/app/[locale]/page.ts
import { ClientComponentExample, ServerComponentExample } from '@component/components';
import { type NextPageIntlayer, LocaleClientContextProvider } from 'next-intlayer';
import { LocaleServerContextProvider } from 'next-intlayer/server';

const Page: NextPageIntlayer = ({ params: { locale } }) => {
  const content = useIntlayer('page', locale);
  return (
    // Page implementation here
  );
};

export default Page;
```

For more detailed usage of intlayer into Client, or Server component, see the [nextJS example here](https://github.com/aypineau/intlayer/blob/main/examples/nextjs-app/src/app/%5Blocale%5D/demo-usage-components/page.tsx).

## Configuration File Support

Intlayer accepts multiple configuration file formats:

- `intlayer.config.ts`
- `intlayer.config.js`
- `intlayer.config.json`
- `intlayer.config.cjs`
- `intlayer.config.mjs`
- `.intlayerrc`

To see how to configure available locales, or other parameter, refer to the [configuration documentation here] (https://github.com/aypineau/intlayer/blob/main/docs/configuration.md).
