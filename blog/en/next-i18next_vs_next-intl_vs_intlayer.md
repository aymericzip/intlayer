# next-i18next VS next-intl VS Intlayer | Next.js Internationalization (i18n)

Below is a concise comparison of **three popular libraries** for internationalizing (i18n) a Next.js application: **next-intl**, **next-i18next**, and **Intlayer**.

This document highlights key criteria:

1. **Architecture** (keeping translations close to their components)
2. **TypeScript support**
3. **Management of missing translations**
4. **Server Components support**
5. **Enhanced routing & middleware** for Next.js
6. **Simplicity of setup**

The guide also provides an **in-depth look at Intlayer**, showing why it can be a strong choice—especially for Next.js 13+, including **App Router** and **Server Components**.

## Overview of Each Library

### 1. next-intl

**Main Focus**: Quick and easy setup with a lightweight approach to localization.

- **Architecture**: Encourages co-locating translations in a single folder (e.g., `locales/`) but also allows multiple strategies. Does not strictly enforce “translation per component” architecture.
- **TypeScript Support**: Basic TypeScript integration. Some type definitions exist, but they are not heavily centered on auto-generating TypeScript definitions from your translation files.
- **Missing Translations**: Basic fallback mechanism. By default, falls back to a key or a default locale string. No robust out-of-the-box tooling for advanced missing translations checks.
- **Server Components Support**: Works with Next.js 13+ in general, but the pattern is less specialized for deep server-side usage (e.g., server components with complex dynamic routing).
- **Routing & Middleware**: Middleware support is possible but limited. Typically relies on Next.js `Middleware` for locale detection, or manual configuration for rewriting locale paths.
- **Setup Simplicity**: Very straightforward. Minimal boilerplate is needed.

**Use when**: You want a simpler approach or are comfortable managing your translations in more conventional ways (like one folder with locale JSON files).

### 2. next-i18next

**Main Focus**: Time-tested solution using `i18next` under the hood, widely adopted for Next.js projects.

- **Architecture**: Often organizes translations in the `public/locales` folder. Not specifically designed to keep translations “close” to each component, though you can manually adopt a different structure.
- **TypeScript Support**: Reasonable TypeScript coverage but requires custom configuration for typed translations and typed hooks.
- **Missing Translations**: i18next offers interpolation/fallbacks. However, missing translation detection typically needs extra setup or third-party plugins.
- **Server Components Support**: Basic usage with Next.js 13 is documented, but advanced usage (e.g., deep integration with server components, dynamic route generation) can be cumbersome.
- **Routing & Middleware**: Relies heavily on Next.js `Middleware` and rewrites for locale subpaths. For more complex setups, you might need to dive into advanced i18next configuration.
- **Setup Simplicity**: Familiar approach for those used to i18next. However, it can get more boilerplate-heavy when advanced i18n features are needed (namespaces, multiple fallback locales, etc.).

**Use when**: You’re already committed to the `i18next` ecosystem or have existing i18next-based translations.

### 3. Intlayer

**Main Focus**: A modern, open-source i18n library specifically tailored for Next.js **App Router** (12, 13, 14, and 15) with built-in support for **Server Components** and **Turbopack**.

#### Key Advantages

1. **Architecture**

   - Encourages placing **translations right next to their components**. Each page or component can have its own `.content.ts` (or JSON) file—no more rummaging through a giant translation folder.
   - This makes your code more **modular and maintainable**, especially in large codebases.

2. **TypeScript Support**

   - **Auto-generated type definitions**: The moment you define your content, Intlayer generates types that power autocomplete and catch translation errors.
   - Minimizes runtime errors like missing keys and offers advanced **autocomplete** directly in your IDE.

3. **Management of Missing Translations**

   - During build, Intlayer can **detect missing translation keys** and throw warnings or errors.
   - This ensures you never accidentally ship with missing text across your languages.

4. **Optimized for Server Components**

   - Fully compatible with the Next.js **App Router** and the new **Server Components** paradigm.
   - Provides specialized providers (`IntlayerServerProvider`, `IntlayerClientProvider`) to **isolate server context** (vital when dealing with Next.js 13+).

5. **Enhanced Routing & Middleware**

   - Includes a dedicated [**`intlayerMiddleware`**](#) for **automatic locale detection** (via cookies or browser headers) and advanced route generation.
   - Dynamically handles localized paths (e.g., `/en-US/about` vs. `/fr/about`) with minimal configuration.
   - Offers helper methods like `getMultilingualUrls` for generating alternate language links (great for **SEO**).

6. **Simplified Setup**
   - A single config file (`intlayer.config.ts`) to define your locales, default locale, and integration preferences.
   - A wrapper plugin `withIntlayer(nextConfig)` that **injects** all environment variables and watchers for your content.
   - **No large fallback configurations**—the system is built to “just work” with minimal friction.

> **Bottom line**: Intlayer is a modern solution that wants to **push best practices**: from **keeping translations close** to each React component, to offering **robust TS support** and **easy server-side** usage, while **drastically reducing boilerplate**.

## Why Intlayer?

For teams migrating to or building on top of **Next.js App Router** (versions 13, 14, or 15) with **Server Components**, Intlayer provides:

1. **A Streamlined Architecture**

   - Each route or component holds its own translations. This fosters clarity and maintainability.

2. **Powerful TypeScript Integration**

   - You gain compiler-level safety, avoiding “typo-laden” or missing translation keys.

3. **Real Missing Translation Alerts**

   - If you forget a key or language translation, you’ll be warned at build time (rather than shipping an incomplete UI).

4. **Built-In Advanced Routing**

   - Automatic locale detection, dynamic route generation, and easy localized URL management are included.
   - A standard `intlayerMiddleware` does not require deep custom rewrites.

5. **One-Stop Setup**

   - Minimal boilerplate: simply define your `intlayer.config.ts`, wrap `next.config` with `withIntlayer`, and add the official middleware.
   - Clear, straightforward usage for both **server** and **client** components via `IntlayerServerProvider` and `IntlayerClientProvider`.

6. **SEO-Friendly**
   - Built-in helpers (`getMultilingualUrls`, `hrefLang` attributes, etc.) make it easy to produce SEO-compliant pages and sitemaps.

## Example: Intlayer in Action

Below is a _very_ condensed snippet illustrating how to harness Intlayer in a Next.js 15 project. For the full details and code examples, [check out the full Intlayer guide](#).

<details>
<summary>Step-by-step example</summary>

1. **Install & Configure**

   ```bash
   npm install intlayer next-intlayer
   ```

   ```ts
   // intlayer.config.ts
   import { Locales, type IntlayerConfig } from "intlayer";

   const config: IntlayerConfig = {
     internationalization: {
       locales: [Locales.ENGLISH, Locales.FRENCH, Locales.SPANISH],
       defaultLocale: Locales.ENGLISH,
     },
   };
   export default config;
   ```

2. **Use the Plugin**

   ```ts
   // next.config.mjs
   import { withIntlayer } from "next-intlayer/server";

   /** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
   const nextConfig = {};

   export default withIntlayer(nextConfig);
   ```

3. **Add Middleware**

   ```ts
   // src/middleware.ts
   export { intlayerMiddleware as middleware } from "next-intlayer/middleware";

   export const config = {
     matcher:
       "/((?!api|static|assets|robots|sitemap|sw|service-worker|manifest|.*\\..*|_next).*)",
   };
   ```

4. **Create a Localized Layout**

   ```tsx
   // src/app/[locale]/layout.tsx
   import { getHTMLTextDir } from "intlayer";
   import { NextLayoutIntlayer } from "next-intlayer";

   const LocaleLayout: NextLayoutIntlayer = async ({ children, params }) => {
     const { locale } = params;
     return (
       <html lang={locale} dir={getHTMLTextDir(locale)}>
         <body>{children}</body>
       </html>
     );
   };

   export { generateStaticParams } from "next-intlayer";
   export default LocaleLayout;
   ```

5. **Declare & Use Content**

   ```tsx
   // src/app/[locale]/page.content.ts
   import { t } from "intlayer";

   export default {
     key: "page",
     content: {
       getStarted: {
         main: t({
           en: "Get started by editing",
           fr: "Commencez par éditer",
           es: "Comience por editar",
         }),
         pageLink: "src/app/page.tsx",
       },
     },
   };
   ```

   ```tsx
   // src/app/[locale]/page.tsx
   import { IntlayerServerProvider } from "next-intlayer/server";
   import { IntlayerClientProvider, useIntlayer } from "next-intlayer";

   const PageContent = () => {
     const { content } = useIntlayer("page");
     return (
       <>
         <p>{content.getStarted.main}</p>
         <code>{content.getStarted.pageLink}</code>
       </>
     );
   };

   export default function Page({ params }) {
     return (
       <IntlayerServerProvider locale={params.locale}>
         <IntlayerClientProvider locale={params.locale}>
           <PageContent />
         </IntlayerClientProvider>
       </IntlayerServerProvider>
     );
   }
   ```

   </details>
