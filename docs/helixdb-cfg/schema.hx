// Start building your schema here.
//
// The schema is used to to ensure a level of type safety in your queries.
//
// The schema is made up of Node types, denoted by N::,
// and Edge types, denoted by E::
//
// Under the Node types you can define fields that
// will be stored in the database.
//
// Under the Edge types you can define what type of node
// the edge will connect to and from, and also the
// properties that you want to store on the edge.
//
// Example:
//
N::User {
    Name: String,
    Label: String,
    Age: I32,
    IsAdmin: Boolean,
}
E::Knows {
    From: User,
    To: User,
    Properties: {
        Since: I32,
    }
}
