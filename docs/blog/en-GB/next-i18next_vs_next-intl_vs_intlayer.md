# next-i18next VS next-intl VS intlayer | Next.js Internationalisation (i18n)

This guide compares three widely used i18n options for **Next.js**: **next-intl**, **next-i18next**, and **Intlayer**.
We focus on **Next.js 13+ App Router** (with **React Server Components**) and evaluate:

1. **Architecture & content organisation**
2. **TypeScript & safety**
3. **Missing translation handling**
4. **Routing & middleware**
5. **Performance & loading behaviour**
6. **Developer experience (DX), tooling & maintenance**
7. **SEO & large-project scalability**

> **tl;dr**: All three can localise a Next.js app. If you want **component-scoped content**, **strict TypeScript types**, **build-time missing-key checks**, **tree-shaken dictionaries**, and **first-class App Router + SEO helpers**, **Intlayer** is the most complete, modern choice.

---

## High-level positioning

- **next-intl** - Lightweight, straightforward message formatting with solid Next.js support. Centralised catalogues are common; DX is simple, but safety and large-scale maintenance remain mostly your responsibility.
- **next-i18next** - i18next in Next.js attire. Mature ecosystem and features via plugins (e.g., ICU), but configuration can be verbose and catalogues tend to centralise as projects grow.
- **Intlayer** - Component-centric content model for Next.js, **strict TS typing**, **build-time checks**, **tree-shaking**, **built-in middleware & SEO helpers**, optional **Visual Editor/CMS**, and **AI-assisted translations**.

## Deep-dive comparison

### 1) Architecture & scalability

- **next-intl / next-i18next**: Default to **centralised catalogues** per locale (plus **namespaces** in i18next). Works fine early on, but often becomes a big shared surface area with rising coupling and key churn.
- **Intlayer**: Encourages **per-component** (or per-feature) dictionaries **co-located** with the code they serve. This lowers cognitive load, eases duplication/migration of UI pieces, and reduces cross-team conflicts. Unused content is naturally easier to spot and purge.

**Why it matters:** In large codebases or design-system setups, **modular content** scales better than monolithic catalogues.

---

### 2) TypeScript & safety

- **next-intl**: Solid TypeScript support, but **keys aren’t strictly typed by default**; you’ll maintain safety patterns manually.
- **next-i18next**: Base typings for hooks; **strict key typing requires extra tooling/config**.
- **Intlayer**: **Generates strict types** from your content. **IDE autocompletion** and **compile-time errors** catch typos and missing keys before deployment.

**Why it matters:** Strong typing shifts failures **left** (CI/build) instead of **right** (runtime).

---

### 3) Missing translation handling

- **next-intl / next-i18next**: Rely on **runtime fallbacks** (e.g., show the key or default locale). Build doesn’t fail.
- **Intlayer**: **Build-time detection** with **warnings/errors** for missing locales or keys.

**Why it matters:** Catching gaps during build prevents “mystery strings” in production and aligns with strict release gates.

---

### 4) Routing, middleware & URL strategy

- All three work with **Next.js localised routing** on the App Router.
- **Intlayer** goes further with **i18n middleware** (locale detection via headers/cookies) and **helpers** to generate localised URLs and `<link rel="alternate" hreflang="…">` tags.

**Why it matters:** Fewer custom glue layers; **consistent UX** and **clean SEO** across locales.

---

### 5) Server Components (RSC) alignment

- **All** support Next.js 13+.
- **Intlayer** smooths the **server/client boundary** with a consistent API and providers designed for RSC, so you don’t shuttle formatters or t-functions through component trees.

**Why it matters:** Cleaner mental model and fewer edge cases in hybrid trees.

---

### 6) Performance & loading behaviour

- **next-intl / next-i18next**: Partial control via **namespaces** and **route-level splits**; risk of bundling unused strings if discipline slips.
- **Intlayer**: **Tree-shakes** at build and **lazy-loads per dictionary/locale**. Unused content doesn’t ship.

**Why it matters:** Smaller bundles and faster start-up, especially on multi-locale sites.

---

### 7) DX, tooling & maintenance

- **next-intl / next-i18next**: You’ll typically wire up external platforms for translations and editorial workflows.
- **Intlayer**: Ships a **free Visual Editor** and **optional CMS** (Git-friendly or externalised). Plus **VSCode extension** for content authoring and **AI-assisted translations** using your own provider keys.

**Why it matters:** Lowers operational costs and shortens the feedback loop between developers and content authors.

---

## When to choose which?

- **Choose next-intl** if you want a **minimal** solution, you’re comfortable with centralised catalogues, and your app is **small to mid-size**.
- **Choose next-i18next** if you need **i18next’s plugin ecosystem** (e.g., advanced ICU rules via plugins) and your team already knows i18next, accepting **more configuration** for flexibility.
- **Choose Intlayer** if you value **component-scoped content**, **strict TypeScript**, **build-time guarantees**, **tree-shaking**, and **batteries-included** routing/SEO/editor tooling - especially for **Next.js App Router**, design-systems and **large, modular codebases**.

---

## Conclusion

All three libraries succeed at core localisation. The difference is **how much work you must do** to achieve a robust, scalable setup in **modern Next.js**:

- With **Intlayer**, **modular content**, **strict TS**, **build-time safety**, **tree-shaken bundles**, and **first-class App Router + SEO tooling** are **defaults**, not chores.
- If your team values **maintainability and speed** in a multi-locale, component-driven app, Intlayer offers the **most complete** experience today.
