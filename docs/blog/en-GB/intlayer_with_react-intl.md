# How to automate your react-intl JSON translations using Intlayer

## What is Intlayer?

**Intlayer** is an innovative, open-source internationalisation library designed to address the shortcomings of traditional i18n solutions. It offers a modern approach to content management in React applications.

See a concrete comparison with react-intl in our [react-i18next vs. react-intl vs. Intlayer](https://github.com/aymericzip/intlayer/blob/main/docs/blog/en/react-i18next_vs_react-intl_vs_intlayer.md) blog post.

## Why Combine Intlayer with react-intl?

While Intlayer provides an excellent standalone i18n solution (see our [React integration guide](https://github.com/aymericzip/intlayer/blob/main/docs/docs/en/intlayer_with_vite+react.md)), you might want to combine it with react-intl for several reasons:

1. **Existing codebase**: You have an established react-intl implementation and want to gradually migrate to Intlayer's improved developer experience.
2. **Legacy requirements**: Your project requires compatibility with existing react-intl plugins or workflows.
3. **Team familiarity**: Your team is comfortable with react-intl but wants better content management.

**For that, Intlayer can be implemented as an adapter for react-intl to help automate your JSON translations in CLI or CI/CD pipelines, test your translations, and more.**

This guide shows you how to leverage Intlayer's superior content declaration system while maintaining compatibility with react-intl.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Set Up Intlayer with react-intl

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

Install the necessary packages:

```bash packageManager="npm"
npm install intlayer @intlayer/sync-json-plugin
```

```bash packageManager="pnpm"
pnpm add intlayer @intlayer/sync-json-plugin
```

```bash packageManager="yarn"
yarn add intlayer @intlayer/sync-json-plugin
```

**Package descriptions:**

- **intlayer**: Core library for internationalisation management, content declaration, and building
- **@intlayer/sync-json-plugin**: Plugin to export Intlayer content declarations to react-intl compatible JSON format

### Step 2: Implement the Intlayer plugin to wrap the JSON

Create an Intlayer configuration file to define your supported locales:

**If you want to also export JSON dictionaries for react-intl**, add the `syncJSON` plugin:

```typescript fileName="intlayer.config.ts"
import { Locales, type IntlayerConfig } from "intlayer";
import { syncJSON } from "@intlayer/sync-json-plugin";

const config: IntlayerConfig = {
  internationalization: {
    locales: [Locales.ENGLISH, Locales.FRENCH, Locales.SPANISH],
    defaultLocale: Locales.ENGLISH,
  },
  plugins: [
    syncJSON({
      source: ({ key, locale }) => `./intl/messages/${locale}/${key}.json`,
    }),
  ],
};

export default config;
```

The `syncJSON` plugin will automatically wrap the JSON. It will read and write the JSON files without changing the content architecture.

If you want to make that JSON coexist with Intlayer content declaration files (`.content` files), Intlayer will proceed as follows:

    1. load both JSON and content declaration files and transform them into an Intlayer dictionary.
    2. if there are conflicts between the JSON and the content declaration files, Intlayer will proceed to merge all those dictionaries. This depends on the priority of the plugins, and that of the content declaration file (all are configurable).

If changes are made using the CLI to translate the JSON, or using the CMS, Intlayer will update the JSON file with the new translations.

For more details about the `syncJSON` plugin, please refer to the [syncJSON plugin documentation](https://github.com/aymericzip/intlayer/blob/main/docs/docs/en-plugins/sync-json.md).

## Git Configuration

It is recommended to ignore auto-generated Intlayer files:

```plaintext fileName=".gitignore"
# Ignore files generated by Intlayer
.intlayer
```

These files can be regenerated during your build process and do not need to be committed to version control.
