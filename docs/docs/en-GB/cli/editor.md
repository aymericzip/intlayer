# Editor commands

The `editor` command wraps the `intlayer-editor` commands.

> To be able to use the `editor` command, the `intlayer-editor` package must be installed. (See [Intlayer Visual Editor](https://github.com/aymericzip/intlayer/blob/main/docs/docs/en-GB/intlayer_visual_editor.md))

```json fileName="package.json"
"scripts": {
  "intlayer:editor:start": "npx intlayer editor start --with 'next dev --turbopack'"
}
```
