# New Intlayer v6 - What's new?

Welcome to Intlayer v6! This release focuses on performance, developer experience, and reliability. Below are the highlights, with migration notes and copy‑pasteable examples.

## Highlights

- New command: `npx intlayer content test` to detect missing translations
- New global `autoFill` option to auto‑generate missing translations
- Fill command defaults to skipping existing translations: `npx intlayer fill`
- VS Code extension: new Intlayer Activity Bar (Search & Dictionaries), toolbar/context actions, auto‑reveal, Fill/Test commands
- 10× faster builds thanks to promise parallelization
- Remote dictionary caching to avoid refetch at app start
- Improved logging: set `log.mode: 'verbose'` to inspect behavior
- Stronger validation to prevent app crashes on dictionary issues
- Live updates with CMS using `build.importMode = 'live'` and `pnpm intlayer live`
- Fixes: Vue.js integration, Lynx adapter, Visual Editor on Windows

---

## New: Test missing translations

Quickly audit your project to find which keys/locales are missing.

```bash
npx intlayer content test
```

Output:

```bash
pnpm intlayer content test
Missing translations:
 - blog-data       - Japanese (ja), Korean (ko), Chinese (zh), German (de), Italian (it) - src/components/BlogPage/blogData.content.ts
 - demo-page       - French (fr), Italian (it)                                         - src/components/DemoPage/demo.content.ts
 - locale-switcher - Italian (it), Portuguese (pt)                                       - src/components/LocaleSwitcher/localeSwitcher.content.ts
Locales: English (en), Russian (ru), Japanese (ja), French (fr), Korean (ko), Chinese (zh), Spanish (es), German (de), Arabic (ar), Italian (it), British English (en-GB), Portuguese (pt), Hindi (hi)
Required locales: English (en)
Missing locales: Japanese (ja), Korean (ko), Chinese (zh), German (de), Italian (it), French (fr), Portuguese (pt)
Missing required locales: -
Total missing locales: 7
Total missing required locales: 0
```

See more options in the CLI docs: [CLI reference](https://github.com/aymericzip/intlayer/blob/main/docs/docs/en/cli/index.md) → "Test missing translations". As well as the [Testing](https://github.com/aymericzip/intlayer/blob/main/docs/docs/en/testing.md) guide.

## New: Global autoFill to complete missing translations

You can now enable auto‑fill globally so any dictionary with missing translations gets completed automatically.

```ts fileName="intlayer.config.ts"
import { type IntlayerConfig, Locales } from "intlayer";

const config: IntlayerConfig = {
  internationalization: {
    locales: [Locales.ENGLISH, Locales.FRENCH, Locales.SPANISH],
    defaultLocale: Locales.ENGLISH,
    requiredLocales: [Locales.ENGLISH, Locales.FRENCH],
  },
  content: {
    // Auto-generate missing translations for all dictionaries
    autoFill: "./{{fileName}}Filled.content.ts",
    //
    // autoFill: "/messages/{{locale}}/{{key}}/{{fileName}}.content.json",
    //
    // autoFill: true, // auto-generate missing translations for all dictionaries like using "./{{fileName}}.content.json"
    //
    // autoFill: {
    //   en: "./{{fileName}}.en.content.json",
    //   fr: "./{{fileName}}.fr.content.json",
    //   es: "./{{fileName}}.es.content.json",
    // },
  },
};

export default config;
```

Auto-fill your missing translations using the `npx intlayer fill` command.

You can still fine‑tune per dictionary using the `autoFill` field in content files. Intlayer will first consider the per dictionary configuration and then fallback to the global configuration. See the full reference in [Auto-fill](https://github.com/aymericzip/intlayer/blob/main/docs/docs/en/autoFill.md) and [Content file reference](https://github.com/aymericzip/intlayer/blob/main/docs/docs/en/dictionary/content_file.md).

---

## Fill command: safer defaults

The fill command now, by default, only fills missing translations and skips existing content.

```bash
npx intlayer fill
```

```bash
Affected dictionary keys for processing: access-key-creation-form-schema, doc-search-metadata, doc-search-page
  - [access-key-creation-form-schema]      Dictionary has no file path. Skipping.
  - [access-key-creation-form-schema]      Processing content declaration: src/components/Dashboard/ProjectForm/AccessKey/useAccessKeyCreationFormSchema.content.ts
  - [access-key-creation-form-schema]      No locales to fill - Skipping dictionary
  - [doc-search-metadata]                  Dictionary has no file path. Skipping.
  - [doc-search-metadata]                  Processing content declaration: src/app/[locale]/(docs)/doc/search/metadata.content.ts
  - [doc-search-metadata]                  No locales to fill - Skipping dictionary
  - [doc-search-page]                      Dictionary has no file path. Skipping.
  - [doc-search-page]                      Processing content declaration: src/app/[locale]/(docs)/doc/search/page.content.ts
  - [doc-search-page]                     [Russian (ru)]                   Preparing translation for dictionary from English (en) to Russian (ru)
[intlayer]  Applied Prettier formatting to src/app/[locale]/(docs)/doc/search/page.content.ts
  - [doc-search-page]                      Content declaration written to src/app/[locale]/(docs)/doc/search/page.content.ts
```

CI examples are available in [CI/CD](https://github.com/aymericzip/intlayer/blob/main/docs/docs/en/CI_CD.md).

## Updated VS Code extension

The extension now includes a dedicated Intlayer tab in the Activity Bar and several workflow improvements:

- Intlayer Activity Bar with two views:
  - Search webview for live dictionary/content search
  - Dictionaries tree listing environments, dictionaries, and contributing files
- Toolbar on Dictionaries view: Build, Pull, Push, Fill, Refresh, Test, Create Dictionary File
- Context menus: Pull/Push on dictionaries; Fill on files
- Auto‑reveal: the current editor file is highlighted in the Dictionaries tree when applicable
- New commands available from the Command Palette: Fill Dictionaries and Test Dictionaries

See details in the [Official VS Code Extension](https://github.com/aymericzip/intlayer/blob/main/docs/docs/en/vs_code_extension.md) documentation.

---

Updated the MCP server to support the new features.

- Auto-fill
- Test missing translations
- Live updates
- Logging
- Validation
- Migration notes
- Documentation

> MCP server helps for the automatisation of project using Intlayer. Testing missing translations for autogenerated code. It helps understanding your config, and embed the documentation of Intlayer in your IDE.

---

## Performance: 10× faster

- Parallel resolution of local and remote dictionaries
- Remote dictionaries are cached to avoid re‑fetching at app startup

```bash
npx intlayer build
```

Output:

```bash
[intlayer]  Preparing Intlayer (v6.0.1)
[intlayer]  Dictionaries:
[intlayer]  ✓ Local content: 163/163
[intlayer]  ✓ Remote content: 100/100
[intlayer]   - access-key-creation-form             [local: ✔ built] [distant: ✔ imported]
[intlayer]   - access-key-form                      [local: ✔ built] [distant: ✔ imported]
[intlayer]   - ai-ab-testing-section                                 [distant: ✔ imported]

[intlayer]   - blog-nav-list                        [local: ✔ built] [distant: ✔ imported]
[intlayer]   - blog-page                                             [distant: ✔ fetched]
[intlayer]   - blog-search-page                     [local: ✔ built] [distant: ✔ imported]
...
[intlayer]  Content loaded  (Total: 8401ms - Local: 4050ms - Remote: 4222ms)
```

---

## Logging improvements

The logging system has been improved to provide more detailed information about what happens during build and runtime transformations.

> Enable verbose logs to better understand what happens during build and runtime transformations.

```ts fileName="intlayer.config.ts"
export default {
  log: {
    mode: "verbose", // options: "default" | "verbose" | "disabled"
  },
};
```

See [Configuration](https://github.com/aymericzip/intlayer/blob/main/docs/docs/en/configuration.md) for all logging options.

---

## Stronger validation

Dictionary processing now performs more robust validation. When a dictionary fails to process, Intlayer avoids breaking your application and surfaces actionable errors.

---

## Live updates with CMS (Production‑safe)

Serve live content updates (e.g., editorial updates) in production without rebuilding your application.

1. Enable live import mode:

```ts fileName="intlayer.config.ts"
import { type IntlayerConfig } from "intlayer";

const config: IntlayerConfig = {
  build: {
    importMode: "live", // "static" | "dynamic" | "live"
  },
  editor: {
    liveSync: true, // enable live sync server side
  },
};

export default config;
```

2. Run your app and live process side‑by‑side:

```bash
npx intlayer live --with 'vite preview'
```

Notes:

- Only dictionaries flagged to use live mode will be fetched live. Others are optimized for performance.
- Falls back to dynamic import if the live API isn’t reachable.

See [CMS and Live Sync](https://github.com/aymericzip/intlayer/blob/main/docs/docs/en/intlayer_CMS.md) and [Configuration](https://github.com/aymericzip/intlayer/blob/main/docs/docs/en/configuration.md) for complete guidance.

## Parallel process to watch files on turbopack

When using Turbopack on Next.js 14 and above as your development server with the `next dev --turbopack` command, dictionary changes will not be automatically detected by default.

This limitation occurs because Turbopack cannot run webpack plugins in parallel to monitor changes in your content files.

To work around this, we dropped the `intlayer watch` command, using the `--with` option to run both the development server and the Intlayer build watcher simultaneously.

```json5 fileName="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "npx intlayer watch --with 'next dev --turbopack'",
  },
}
```

---

## Migration notes

- Removed: `dictionaryOutput` (previously `i18next` or `next-intl`). This will come back as pluggable adapters in future versions. Remove the field from your config.
- Related removal: `i18nextResourcesDir` (see `doc/configuration` changelog).
- Prefer the new global `content.autoFill` option to generate missing translations at scale.
- Use `npx intlayer content test` to gate PRs on missing translations.
- For verbose diagnostics, set `log.mode = 'verbose'`.
- Use `intlayer` instead of `intlayerPlugin` and `intlayerProxy` instead of `intlayerProxyPlugin` in your Vite configuration.

---

## Fixes

- Vue.js integration stability
- Lynx adapter improvements
- Visual Editor on Windows
