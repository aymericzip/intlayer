## Features

### Instant Navigation

**Go to Definition Support** – Use `⌘ + Click` (Mac) or `Ctrl + Click` (Windows/Linux) on a `useIntlayer` key to open the corresponding content file instantly.  
**Seamless Integration** – Works effortlessly with **react-intlayer** and **next-intlayer** projects.  
**Multi-language Support** – Supports localized content across different languages.  
**VS Code Integration** – Smoothly integrates with VS Code’s navigation and command palette.

### Dictionary Management Commands

Manage your content dictionaries directly from VS Code:

- **Build Dictionaries** – Generate content files based on your project structure.
- **Push Dictionaries** – Upload the latest dictionary content to your repository.
- **Pull Dictionaries** – Sync the latest dictionary content from your repository to your local environment.
- **Fill Dictionaries** – Populate dictionaries with content from your project.
- **Test Dictionaries** – Identify missing or incomplete translations.

### Content Declaration Generator

Easily generate structured dictionary files in different formats:

If you're currently working on a component, it will generate the `.content.{ts,tsx,js,jsx,mjs,cjs,json}` file for you.

Example of component:

```tsx fileName="src/components/MyComponent/index.tsx"
const MyComponent = () => {
  const { myTranslatedContent } = useIntlayer("my-component");

  return <span>{myTranslatedContent}</span>;
};
```

Generated file in TypeScript format:

```tsx fileName="src/components/MyComponent/index.content.ts"
import { t, type Dictionary } from "intlayer";

const componentContent = {
  key: "my-component",
  content: {
    myTranslatedContent: t({
      en: "Hello World",
      es: "Hola Mundo",
      fr: "Bonjour le monde",
    }),
  },
};

export default componentContent;
```

Available formats:

- **TypeScript (`.ts`)**
- **ES Module (`.esm`)**
- **CommonJS (`.cjs`)**
- **JSON (`.json`)**

### Intlayer Tab (Activity Bar)

Open the Intlayer tab by clicking the Intlayer icon in the VS Code Activity Bar. It contains two views:

- **Search**: A live search bar to quickly filter dictionaries and their content. Typing updates the results instantly.
- **Dictionaries**: A tree view of your environments/projects, dictionary keys, and the files contributing entries. You can:
  - Click a file to open it in the editor.
  - Use the toolbar to run actions: Build, Pull, Push, Fill, Refresh, Test, and Create Dictionary File.
  - Use the context menu for item‑specific actions:
    - On a dictionary: Pull or Push
    - On a file: Fill Dictionary
  - When you switch editors, the tree will reveal the matching file if it belongs to a dictionary.

## Installation

You can install **Intlayer** directly from the VS Code Marketplace:

1. Open **VS Code**.
2. Go to the **Extensions Marketplace**.
3. Search for **"Intlayer"**.
4. Click **Install**.

## Usage

### Quick Navigation

1. Open a project using **react-intlayer**.
2. Locate a call to `useIntlayer()`, such as:

   ```tsx
   const content = useIntlayer("app");
   ```

3. **Command-click** (`⌘+Click` on macOS) or **Ctrl+Click** (on Windows/Linux) on the key (e.g., `"app"`).
4. VS Code will automatically open the corresponding dictionary file, e.g., `src/app.content.ts`.

### Managing Content Dictionaries

Use the side tab to browse and manage dictionaries:

- Open the Intlayer icon in the Activity Bar.
