# Intlayer Documentation

Welcome to the Intlayer Documentation. This guide provides an overview of Intlayer, its main features, and how to effectively utilize these documents to enhance your development experience.

## Introduction

### What is Intlayer?

**Intlayer** is an internationalization library designed specifically for JavaScript developers. It allow the declaration of your content everywhere in your code. It converts declaration of multilingual content into structured dictionaries to integrate easily in your code. Using TypeScript, **Intlayer** make your development stronger and more efficient.

Intlayer also provides an optional visual editor that allows you to easily edit and manage your content. This editor is particularly useful for developers who prefer a visual interface for content management, or for teams generating content without having to worry about code.

## Example of usage

```bash
.
├── ClientComponent
│   ├── index.content.ts
│   └── index.tsx
└── ServerComponent
    ├── index.content.ts
    └── index.tsx
```

```tsx
// ./ClientComponent/index.content.ts

import { type DeclarationContent, t } from "intlayer";

const clientComponentContent = {
  key: "client-component",
  content: {
    myTranslatedContent: t({
      en: "Hello World",
      fr: "Bonjour le monde",
      es: "Hola Mundo",
    }),
  },
} satisfies DeclarationContent;

export default clientComponentContent;
```

```tsx
// ./ClientComponent/index.tsx
"use client";

import { useIntlayer } from "next-intlayer";

export const ClientComponent = () => {
  const { myTranslatedContent } = useIntlayer("client-component");

  return <span>{myTranslatedContent}</span>;
};
```
