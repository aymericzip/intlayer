# Documentation: `getEnumerationContent` Function in `intlayer`

## Description:

The `getEnumerationContent` function retrieves content corresponding to a specific quantity based on predefined conditions in an enumeration object. The conditions are defined as keys, and their priority is determined by their order in the object.

## Parameters:

- `enumerationContent: QuantityContent<Content>`

  - **Description**: An object where keys represent conditions (e.g., `<=`, `<`, `>=`, `=`) and values represent the corresponding content. The order of keys defines their matching priority.
  - **Type**: `QuantityContent<Content>`
    - `Content` can be any type.

- `quantity: number`

  - **Description**: The numeric value used to match against the conditions in `enumerationContent`.
  - **Type**: `number`

## Returns:

- **Type**: `Content`
- **Description**: The content corresponding to the first matching condition in the `enumerationContent`. If no match is found, it defaults to handling based on the implementation (e.g., error or fallback content).

## Example Usage:

### Basic Usage:

```typescript
import { getEnumerationContent } from "@intlayer/config/client";

const content = getEnumerationContent(
  {
    "<=-2.3": "You have less than -2.3",
    "<1": "You have less than one",
    "2": "You have two",
    ">=3": "You have three or more",
  },
  2
);

console.log(content); // Output: "You have two"
```

### Priority of Conditions:

```typescript
const content = getEnumerationContent(
  {
    "<4": "You have less than four",
    "2": "You have two",
  },
  2
);

console.log(content); // Output: "You have less than four"
```

## Edge Cases:

- **No Matching Condition:**

  - If no condition matches the provided quantity, the function will either return `undefined` or handle the default/fallback scenario explicitly.

- **Ambiguous Conditions:**

  - If conditions overlap, the first matching condition (based on object order) takes precedence.

- **Invalid Keys:**

  - The function assumes that all keys in `enumerationContent` are valid and parsable as conditions. Invalid or improperly formatted keys may lead to unexpected behavior.

- **TypeScript Enforcement:**
  - The function ensures that the `Content` type is consistent across all keys, allowing for type safety in the retrieved content.

## Notes:

- The `findMatchingCondition` utility is used to determine the appropriate condition based on the given quantity.
