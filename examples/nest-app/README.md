# Intlayer & NestJS Example

This repository demonstrates how to integrate Intlayer with a NestJS backend for internationalization (i18n).

Intlayer is a powerful solution for managing multilingual content in modern JavaScript applications. With the express-intlayer middleware, you can easily add localization support to your NestJS backend, enabling your API to serve responses in multiple languages.

## About NestJS

NestJS is a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications. It is built with TypeScript and leverages Express under the hood, making it compatible with Intlayer's middleware.

## About Intlayer

Intlayer provides a unified approach to internationalization for both frontend and backend applications. It helps you manage translations, content declarations, and locale detection with minimal configuration.
