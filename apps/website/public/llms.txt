# Intlayer Documentation for Agents

Intlayer is a comprehensive internationalization (i18n) framework designed to simplify multilingual support for modern web applications. It provides a unified way to manage content for **React**, **Next.js**, **Vue**, **Svelte**, **Solid**, **Nuxt**, **Astro**, and more.

## Key Offerings

- **Full Framework Support**: Native integration for popular frameworks including React, Next.js, Vue, Svelte, Solid, Nuxt, and Astro.
- **Translation Tooling**: Powerful CLI and CI/CD tools to automate your translation workflows.
- **Visual Editor**: A live editor connected directly to your codebase, allowing you to edit content in real-time.
- **Headless CMS**: A specialized CMS to externalize and manage your content without losing developer control.

This file lists the documentation URLs available in Markdown format for AI agents and bots.

## Intlayer MCP Server (Recommended)

For a better experience, we recommend using the **Intlayer MCP Server**. It provides context-aware documentation and smart CLI integration for your AI agent.

### Key Features

- **Context-Aware Documentation**: Automatically exposes Intlayer's documentation to your AI agent, ensuring code suggestions and explanations are always accurate and up to date.
- **Smart CLI Integration**: Allows your AI assistant to run Intlayer CLI commands (e.g., `intlayer dictionaries build`, `intlayer dictionaries fill`) directly to manage your translations.
- **Improved Autocompletion**: Enhances your IDE's ability to provide relevant intlayer-specific code snippets and configurations.
- **Multi-IDE Support**: Compatible with **Cursor**, **VS Code**, **Claude Desktop**, and any environment supporting the Model Context Protocol.

### Usage

- **Local server (stdio):** `npx -y @intlayer/mcp`
- **Remote server (SSE):** `https://mcp.intlayer.org`

For more information, see the [Intlayer MCP Server documentation](https://intlayer.org/doc/mcp-server.md).
