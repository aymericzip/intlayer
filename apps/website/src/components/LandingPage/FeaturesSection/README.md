# FeaturesSection Component - Mobile Optimization

## Overview

This component has been optimized for mobile devices to address performance and rendering issues identified in the original implementation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Mobile-Optimized Version (`MobileFeaturesSection/`)

- **Simplified Interface**: Replaced complex carousel with accordion-style expandable sections
- **Reduced Animations**: Simplified animations using basic fade-in and scale transitions
- **Performance Optimizations**: 
  - Disabled SSR for heavy components (`ssr: false`)
  - Used `useCallback` for event handlers
  - Simplified state management
- **Design System Integration**: Utilized `Container` component from `@intlayer/design-system`

### 2. Responsive Detection

- Uses `useDevice()` hook to detect mobile devices
- Automatically switches between desktop and mobile versions
- Mobile version only renders on small screens

### 3. Mobile-Specific Features

- **Accordion Layout**: Each feature section can be expanded/collapsed
- **Touch-Friendly**: Larger touch targets and simplified interactions
- **Reduced Motion**: Minimal animations to prevent frame drops
- **Optimized Loading**: Lazy loading with loading states

## Performance Improvements

- **Reduced Scroll Calculations**: No complex scroll-based animations on mobile
- **Simplified Rendering**: Linear layout instead of complex positioning
- **Lighter Animations**: Basic CSS transitions instead of heavy Framer Motion
- **Conditional Loading**: Heavy components only load when expanded

## Usage

The component automatically detects the device type and renders the appropriate version:

- **Desktop**: Full carousel with scroll-based animations
- **Mobile**: Accordion-style expandable sections

1. Resize browser to mobile viewport
2. Or use browser dev tools mobile emulation
3. Verify smooth scrolling and touch interactions
4. Check that animations are lightweight and performant
