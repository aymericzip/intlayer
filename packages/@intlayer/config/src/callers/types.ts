/**
 * Shared caller-descriptor model.
 *
 * A "caller" is any function or JSX component through which application code
 * reads intlayer content: the base getters (`useIntlayer`, `getIntlayer`) and
 * every compat-adapter entry point (`useTranslation`, `useTranslations`,
 * `formatMessage`, lingui's `t`/`_`, …).
 *
 * This registry is the single source of truth consumed by:
 * - `@intlayer/babel` — field-usage analysis (purge/minify) and the optimize
 *   pass that rewrites caller invocations to `useDictionary(...)` /
 *   `useDictionaryDynamic(...)` with pre-imported dictionaries.
 * - `@intlayer/swc` — the same optimize pass for Next.js builds; descriptors
 *   are serialised to the plugin's wire format via `toSwcExtraCallers`.
 * - `@intlayer/lsp` and the VS Code extension — AST/regex matchers powering
 *   go-to-definition, references and completion.
 * - Each compat package's bundler plugin — injects its library's descriptors
 *   into the pipelines above, so no compat-specific name is hard-coded in the
 *   core packages.
